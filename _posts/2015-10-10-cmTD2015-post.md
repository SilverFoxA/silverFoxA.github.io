We (Team - Elpha, product - Dia-LivMe) tried to solve the problem of educating (awareness)the people about diabetes, recording and reporting blood glucose, dietry advice, enebaling the patient to access social support as well as identifying foot ulcer.I still believe, we could have won the competition but because of lack of understanding between us and misplaced of keypoints in the presentation we loose the competition. But winning and loosing is a part of life so I strongly believe that the same situation won't come to our team in near future. We have big plans on making it a framework rather than just a solution. We want it to help both patient and clinician in all manners.
