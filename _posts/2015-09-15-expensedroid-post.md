<font size="4">This is my very first android application. The idea of making the following app came to me out of blue. After learning Java I planned on getting into Android Developement as it was new to me then and I was very much interested. So I statrted working on it on July.  Being an undergraduate has it's own benefit as well as drawbacks, one of the major drawback is lack of time because of the internals as well as the assignments. Out of the busy schedule I used to work during the ongoing sessions, break time as well as at night as long as I could, it was fun even more then attending the session.  </font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">There was a day when I was also a noob to git and a crazy thing happend. Well when you are new to a field few crazy stuff will happen which helps you understand the poblem more and will tell you a simplified way to do it in next phase of the operation or developement. The crazy thing was that I don't used to add all my source files to git as I wasn't aware of it back then, so one day by mistake I have refractored a system keyword which spoiled my entire code. As I didn't have the entire source code because i wasn't adding the new files created to git I was so depressed and frustrated. So that night I had an wonderful opportunity to work all night and completed the code back from scratch, I was bit lucky too as that time the app was only 1/4.</font>

<br/><font size="4">
I as the developer don't plan on monetising the app by selling the icons or any new features that we will be adding on the go, so whatever we add all will be free to users. The app is completely free and upgradable based on user's feedback.
